# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is an implementation with minor improvements of a popular board game "Five in a row"(or "Gomoku", or tic-tac-toe an enlarged board). Where you play against AI.

## How to play?
The aim of the game is to form a sequence of 5 (or more) noughts or crosses in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally).

Two players make actions one by one (placing cross or nought in any free cell on a board). 
The player who creates such sequence first wins the game.

## AI algorithm
The AI is created with minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning.

##  Bugs, improvements
Just create an issue for any reason.
